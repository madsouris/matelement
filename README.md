# Matelement

Material Element. Modern, beautiful CSS Framework.

Initial Design: https://www.figma.com/file/biC9imdeFgIVZFhrYZ2yKU/MaterialElement?node-id=0%3A1

> This is in a very early development stage

## Goal

While I really like Bootstrap and Foundation framework, I have a vision for this framework to have a very good looking design also very quick to load and won't conflict with other stuff, I mean you can just use it on top of something like Bootstrap or Foundation.

In the future I really want to turn this into a full feature framework with Javascript interaction and everything, but right now I only focus on the CSS part.

## Features

- [ ]  Light mode and Dark mode

- [ ]  Clean looking material design

- [ ]  Lightweight

- [ ]  Won't conflict with other frameworks

- [ ]  Responsive, of course
